--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT avg(danceability) as danceability, artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Which are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--Which artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc 
LIMIT 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT track_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, popularity 
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
